1. Derive unit and associativity laws for the tensor product defined as composition of endo-1-cells in a bicategory.
	 unit laws:
	 f * id(a) -> f
    id(b) * f -> f
	 id(b) * f * id(a) -> f
	 
	 associativity

	 (g * id(b)) * f = g * (id(b) * f) is isomorphic to g * f

2. Check that monad laws for a monad in 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐧 correspond to identity and associativity laws in the resulting category.

	 Monad laws:
		  return :: a -> M(a)
		  Kleisli operator :: (a -> m(b)) -> (b -> m(c)) -> (a -> m(c))
		  bind :: m(a) -> (a -> m(b)) -> m(b)

	 Span Laws:
	    id :: a -> S(a,a)
	    associativity :: S(a,b) -> S(b,c) -> S(a,c)

		  id and return are trivially identical. Let's first re-write Kleisli operator in terms of spans
		  Kleisli operator :: (a -> S(a,b)) -> (b -> S(b,c)) -> (a -> S(a,c))

		  now substitute id(a) and id(b) for a and b
	 
		  (S(a,a) -> S(a,b)) -> (S(b,b) -> S(b,c)) -> (S(a,a) -> S(a,c))

		  Now lets suppose we have these 2 functions
				f :: a->b
            g :: b->c

		  We can express them as spans using the unit law id(b) * f * id(a) which is to say that f is a span from a to b

		     f -> S(a,b)
		     g -> S(b,c)

		  For clarity I will replace all the span notation above with (a,b,f,g)

		  (a -> f) -> (b -> g) -> (a -> f * g) aka (a->c) or in span notation S(a,c)

		  Which is to say if I can apply a to f and b to g then I can apply a to f * g. f * g gives use c so the end result is the associativity law for spans
	 
		   f -> g -> f * g = S(a,b) -> S(b,c) -> S(a,c)

	 

3. Show that a monad in 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐟 is an identity-on-objects functor.
	 *** This question intentionally left blank ***

4. What’s a monad algebra for a monad in 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐧?
	 Replace T(x) with S(x,x) and you have a T algebra for Spans.
